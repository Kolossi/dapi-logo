## DAPI Logo

The files in this repo are for the DAPI team "build on DAPI" logo, and DAPI keystone emoji.

This includes a zip of the "FFF Tusj" font by [Magnus Cederholm](http://www.formfett.net/) which is free for both personal and commercial use.

To use the font, drag the .ttf font file to the `Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Fonts` display

To edit the logo or icon/emoji, use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) and load the relevant *.xml file. If you have only just installed the font, you'll need to exit all browser windows before reopening and loading this up.

The "Dapi Blue" colour is `#205CA4` or `rgb (32,92,164)`
